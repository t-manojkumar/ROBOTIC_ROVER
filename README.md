# ROBOTIC_ROVER
The project is designed to develop a Robotic Rover vehicle with  a soft holding gripper. It can be used for pick and place of an object.  It can sense whether the object picked is metallic or non-metallic. It  can also detect the rover is in gaseous surrounding or not. It can also tell the  temperature and humidity level.
